# StrangeLoop

I thought about essentially talking about all the cool techs I learned about while at StrangeLoop, but then Thad asked Christy and I to talk about that at the annual meeting, so I had to abandon ship and think of a new idea.

So instead I'm going to talk to you about what led me to first find out about StrangeLoop.

# Types

<!-- slide, text "Types" -->

When I first started learning to code in Java, I hated types.

<!-- slide, basic type signature and program; animate other parts? -->

I would painstakingly type out these signatures in my program to appease what I suspected at the time was a legitimate monster living in my computer who would occasionally gobble up my up my code and spit out nasty error messages afterwards.  If I was lucky, he would stay silent, and my program would run.  Pretty soon I got fed up and learned python.

<!-- Slide, python code -->

Much easier.  Not a type in sight.

<!-- More complicated type signature, with hidden error -->

Of course as I learned more, my projects became more complex, I realized that even though I wasn't writing down the types in my Python program, I was still having to think about the, and I realized what static typing really was; a visual representation, a name and reminder, of what things in my program were.  Types were MY way to talking to the computer and telling it what I was doing, and the type checker was how the computer talked back.
